    <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Comparing  the Just Value of an Emerald Gardens House to the Model Predictions</h2>

    <p>You can examine the comparison of the model's predictions to the Property Appraiser's Just Value by selecting a house from the drop-down list. If you want to narrow your selections, you can <strong>Filter by Street</strong> so that the <strong>Select House Address</strong> list shows only those houses on that street.</p

    <p>As soon as you select a house, the light blue cards will show you the factors that went into the model's estimation and the Property Appraiser's Just valuation. The cards in the <strong>Predicted Values</strong> column show :</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High:</strong> mean estimate plus 2 standard deviations.</li>
        <li><strong>Mean:</strong> mean estimate</li>
        <li><strong>Low:</strong> mean estimate minus 2 standard deviations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Important: I don't know the valuation formula used by the Property Appraiser.</strong> My estimations are based solely on the statistical computations of the model. While there are outliers, you will find that the model's estimations are very near the Property Appraiser's valuations.</p>

    <p>The upper and lower figures show a band of valuations which encompasses 95% of the variance in the estimation. That means the the the likelihood of the Property Appraiser's figure has a 95% probability of falling somewhere between the high and low figures.</p>

    <p>Each January, the Sarasota County Property Appraiser estimates the <strong>fair market value</strong> of every parcel in the county. In this context, "fair market value" refers to a conservative estimate, typically 5% to 10% lower than the expected sale price of a property.</p>

    <p>Another key component in this calculation is the <strong>cost of sale</strong>, which includes expenses such as broker commissions, title searches, and document preparation. Based on historical litigation, the Property Appraiser applies a 15% reduction to account for these costs.</p>

    <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Example Calculation:</strong> If a house sells for $500,000 in an arms-length transaction, the "just value" is computed as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sale Price:</strong> $500,000</li>
            <li><strong>Conservative Estimate (-10%):</strong> -$50,000</li>
            <li><strong>Cost of Sale (-15%):</strong> -$75,000</li>
            <li><strong>Just Value:</strong> <strong>$375,000</strong></li>
        </ul>
